# 🌲 Cypress, from Zero to the Cloud ☁️

Sample project for the "Cypress, from Zero to the Cloud" course of the Talking About Testing online school.

## Pre-requirements
It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to clone and run this project.

I've used versions 2.43.0, 22.12.0, 11.0.0, 13.12.0 of git, Node.js, npm, Cypress respectively. I suggest you use the same or later LTS versions.

## Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests
In this project, you can run the tests on a desktop or mobile viewport.

To execute, type the commands in the terminal

- npm run cy:open => open Cypress in interactive mode (with a graphical interface)
- npm run cy:test => run Cypress tests in headless mode (without opening the interface)
- npm run cy:viewPort410 => open Cypress in interactive mode (with a graphical interface) on a mobile viewport
- npm run viewPort410Headless => run Cypress tests in headless mode (without opening the interface) on a mobile viewport and video
